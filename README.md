# TriangleTrig
 This repo is designed to make doing math work, particulary triangle trigonometry more efficient. Please note, your teacher or professor will probably still require you to show work on these problems even though you are using these scripts.

Also note, all classes/scripts are depending on AngleConversions to convert angle measurements from radians to degrees and from degrees to radians.
